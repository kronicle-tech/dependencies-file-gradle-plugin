          When added to a Gradle-based codebase, the plugin generates a `gradle-dependencies.yaml` file for each 
          project in the codebase where the plugin is enabled.  The `gradle-dependencies.yaml` file contains the 
          details of all of a Gradle project's dependencies and is similar to npm's `package-lock.json` file, except 
          the `gradle-dependencies.yaml` is only used for recording the details of dependencies used and is not used 
          to "lock" those dependencies.
